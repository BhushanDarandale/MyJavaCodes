                                      Diffrence_ArrayList_Vector



     1.Synchronization :
                    Vector is synchronized at a time  one thread can access the code while arrayList is 
                    not synchronized,multiple threads can work on arrayList at same time. 
     
     2.Performance: 
                    ArrayList is fast as it is non-synchronized while vector operations give slow 
                    performance as they are synchronized(thread-safe). If one thread works on vector has 
                    acquired lock on it which makes other thread will has to wait till lock is released.
     
     3.Capacity Increment: 
                    ArrayList and Vector both grow and shrink dynamically to maintain optimal use of storage.
                    But the way they resized is different. ArrayList increments 50% of current array size if 
                    number of elements exceeds its capacity while vector increments 100% means doubles the 
                    current array size.
      
      4.Iteration: 
                    Vector can use both Enumeration and Iterator for traversing over elements of vector while
                    ArrayList can only use Iterator for traversing.
